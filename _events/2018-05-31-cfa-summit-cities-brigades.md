summary: Brigades across the country want to help improve the way government works and add capacity, but local government often struggles to utilize this help. This panel-style talk – featuring Mateo Clarke from the City of Austin – focuses on the process by which Brigades and cities/regions can collaborate for right-sized impact. The discussion will center on some of the straightforward challenges government faces and the many ways that Brigades can be helpful to government outside of delivering software. We will also surface some of the stickier challenges that persist and ways that some Brigades have attempted to meet those harder challenges. For municipal and state governments currently without a Brigade, we'll touch on ways that civic tech communities have formed from the groundswell of energy around civic engagement. This panel will be instructive for Brigades and cities/regions while also providing insight for state-level government.
