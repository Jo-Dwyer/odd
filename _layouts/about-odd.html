          <h4>We launched our Office of Design &amp; Delivery in May 2018 to scale our capacity for designing and delivering the best possible services for our residents.</h4>

          <h4>Our culture is our strongest asset. We believe that work should be fun, that learning is ongoing, and that everyone has something to teach. We ask for help, default to action, and balance short-term wins with long-term outcomes. We have strong opinions, loosely held, and we’re open by default.</h4>
